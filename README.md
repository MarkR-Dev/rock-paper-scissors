# rock-paper-scissors

This is a project for JavaScript practice, this program is a implementation of a grade-school classic "rock paper scissors". Initially the game was played entirely through the browser console but has since been updated to feature a UI.

Topics covered:
Console - Numbers(maths methods), strings(formatting), conditionals, functions(scope), loops

UI - Javascript DOM, simple css

Git usage improved compared to previous projects.
